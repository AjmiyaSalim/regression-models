#  Regression Models Collection

This repository contains beginner-friendly regression model projects using real-world datasets. It is organized into two subprojects:

- **Simple Linear Regression**
- **Polynomial Regression**

Each project includes a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating step-by-step model creation, training, and evaluation using Python and scikit-learn.

##  What is Regression?

**Regression** is a supervised machine learning technique used to predict a continuous dependent variable based on one or more independent variables. It's widely used in forecasting, trend analysis, and risk assessment.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Simple Linear Regression

Simple Linear Regression models the relationship between two variables by fitting a straight line. It's defined as:

\[
y = mx + c
\]

Where:
- \( y \) is the dependent variable,
- \( x \) is the independent variable,
- \( m \) is the slope,
- \( c \) is the intercept.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Polynomial Regression

Polynomial Regression extends linear regression by introducing polynomial terms to capture non-linear relationships:

\[
y = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + \dots + a_nx^n
\]

This allows the model to fit curves, making it suitable for more complex data trends.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

This project demonstrates how regression techniques can be applied to real-world problems. By comparing simple linear and polynomial regression, we understand how different models perform based on the nature of data. Simple linear regression works well for linear trends, while polynomial regression captures more complex patterns.
