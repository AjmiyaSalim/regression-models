#  Polynomial Regression

This project demonstrates the use of **Polynomial Regression** for modeling and predicting data with non-linear relationships. It builds upon simple linear regression by adding polynomial features to better fit the data.

##  What is Polynomial Regression?

**Polynomial Regression** is a type of regression that models the relationship between the independent variable \( x \) and the dependent variable \( y \) as an nth-degree polynomial:

\[
y = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + \dots + a_nx^n
\]

It is useful when the data shows a **curved trend** that cannot be captured by a straight line.

## âœ… Conclusion

Polynomial regression provides a powerful approach to fit non-linear patterns in data. This project showcases how increasing model complexity can improve prediction performance â€” but also highlights the need to balance **accuracy** and **overfitting**.
