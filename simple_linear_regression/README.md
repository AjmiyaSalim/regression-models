# 📉 Simple Linear Regression

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of **Simple Linear Regression** using Python and scikit-learn.

## 🔍 What is Simple Linear Regression?

**Simple Linear Regression** is a statistical method that models the relationship between two continuous variables — one **independent variable** (input) and one **dependent variable** (output) — by fitting a straight line to the observed data.

The model takes the form:

\[
y = mx + c
\]

Where:
- \( y \) is the predicted output,
- \( x \) is the input variable,
- \( m \) is the slope of the line,
- \( c \) is the y-intercept.

It is used for forecasting, trend lines, and understanding relationships between variables.

This model uses a simple linear approach to predict relationships between two variables.
